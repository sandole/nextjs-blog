summary: help candidates pass the technical interview for tech companies
---

If you are a software engineer preparing for software engineer (and related) jobs, there is no way you have not heard of Leetcode. There are so many good Leetcode resources out there:  

- Blind 75: I believe this list was created by a tech Lead in Facebook a couple of years ago. This person noticed that most of the tech interviews revolve around a small pool of questions and thinks these 75 questions form the core of data structures and algorithm knowledge.

- Grokking the Coding Interview: this is an online course provided by educative.io. However, there are many free resource you can view online including those available on Github. I was told that it is absolutely not necessary to purchase the course. More resources and questions for tech interview prep!

- seanprashad.com: I am studying mainly off of this one. I assume it was made by Sean Prashad and he aggregated an even more exhaustive list of 171 questions and neatly categorized them to help prepare candidates.

- Cracking the coding interview: I believe this is the bible of tech interview prep. I am still reading through it but it talks about all the steps of tech companies' recruitment process. All the way from hiring committee to system design knowledge.

- Leetcode Must do easy & medium questions: https://leetcode.com/list/xix1yu51/ https://leetcode.com/list/xixy4dq7/

Although these resources are not exactly Leetcode, they are all supposed to help candidates pass the technical interview for tech companies. The word is there is more to study - leadership principle for Amazon, general interview questions / behavioural question responses, system design - and I am already swamped by the workload but I guess it is part of the grind. Hopefully, this grind for the next two years pays off!
