summary: Canadian Armed Forces' (CAF) way of managing our soldiers education and training online
---

DLN stands for distance learning network and it is the Canadian Armed Forces' (CAF) way of managing our soldiers education and training online. There are also other government institutions that allow this like GCCampus (will be mentioned in later blogs) but DLN really focuses what the soldiers need to learn to take on our day-to-day challenges at work.  

We are alotted plenty of time to accomplish these courses online but make no mistake; some of these courses are very challenging. This is because unlike normal online learning courses where supplemental learning material is available online elsewhere, there is no other material / other people's know-hows available for security reasons.

I appreciate the CAF's effort on establishing a fully reliable LMS that ensures that our soldiers are educated through online means where we can learn at our own pace. The military as an institution is truly taking some progressive steps to modernize itself.
