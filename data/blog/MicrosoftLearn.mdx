Microsoft Learn is Microsoft's very own learning management system (LMS). One may think why Microsoft decided to come up with their own LMS and what content they have to offer. Spoiler: TONS.

Microsoft Learn offers a ton of courses and certificates. Some famous examples of these are AZ-104 and AZ-900. Although courses normally range around USD $100, Microsoft is generous to offer challenges that upon completion, will give users vouchers for free trials at these examinations. If you pass the examination, you will get a certificate which is extremely valuable on your resume according to https://www.reddit.com/r/AzureCertification/comments/mc6u3p/azure_developer_associate_will_be_hard/.

I have currently finished one of these challenges called Microsoft Ignite which will allow me to take an exam of my choice. Eligible exams include only those listed below:
