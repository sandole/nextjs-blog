I received my certification for AZ-204 Azure Developer Associate!

I have aggressively studied for the completion of my AZ-204 as well. I decided to take the exam today as I realized that I am a member of Department of National Defence and Canadian Forces for Microsoft's Enterprise Skills Initiative. 

This initiative from Microsoft allows members of the tenant to take exams for free which means I was alotted two free tries for AZ-204. I had to use my free voucher from 2021 November Microsoft Ignite challenge by end of March 2022 so I decided to see where I would place if I were to take the exam now.

Fortunately, I passed on my first try. This will be another great step towards becoming a software engineer!
