summary: Microsoft allows the users to try out their Game Pass
---

I was looking around for ways to play Age of Empires 4 for a cheaper way than paying the full CAD $71.99 for the barebone version. Some of my friends recommended torrenting it but I always believed that the creators should get what they deserve for creative work that they produce. Honestly, it has more to do with how lazy I am to set up a torrent on my computer.

Then I came across Microsoft Game Pass. For an extremely low price of CAD $1.12, Microsoft allows the users to try out their Game Pass platform with hundreds of games for three months! I think three months is more than enough to see if you should buy a game or not. With my competitive nature and my love for real-time strategy games (think sports as well!, I know this is going to be one of my favourite games of all time.

I downloaded the game; I am most likely going to proceed with the campaign since I have seen some videos of gameplays and the graphics and contents look very promising. I will then probably look through some high level players' gameplay for an edge on competitive play later. Regardless, I am very excited to be a part of this AOE 4 community.
