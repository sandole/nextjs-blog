summary: I wanted to start right away
---

I can't exactly pinpoint the time when I decided this was going to be my passion. Maybe it was all the agonizing moments during labs back in school or maybe it was when I realized flying planes was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
Or maybe it was when I kept hearing about my old friends' success stories in the tech industry. I would even go as far as maybe it was when I saw some Youtube videos about becoming software engineer. In any case, I was intrigued.

I dug through the web to find some surface level qualities about this career: work-life balance, salaries, day-to-day tasks. With some real life experience under my belt, I think I began to feel more attracted to this career the more I researched about it.

I wanted to start right away; I felt that I had some catching up to do and I am just not a patient enough of a person to take my time working towards my goal when I know I can take more steps immediately at this second.

I then reached out to my friend working at Google. Stellar friend; he was smart - graduated top of his class in a well-known university - hard-working and genuinely wanted to help me. I asked him a lot of questions. An example of these questions had to do it the possibility of transition from being a military officer to a civillian tech worker.
We chatted for maybe 2 hours; I told him that I would contact him again once I got going in my journey. And that's how it started - my journey from an enlisted serviceman to software developer looking for a job.
