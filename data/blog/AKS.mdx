# Introduction

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is Microsoft's managed Kubernetes offering that simplifies container orchestration and cluster management. 
In this article, I'll discuss the key components, deployment patterns, and integrated tooling that make AKS a robust platform for container workloads.

## Core Components

### Cluster Architecture
AKS follows a standard Kubernetes architecture with some Azure-specific enhancements:
- Control Plane
  - API Server
  - etcd
  - Scheduler
  - Controller Manager
- Node Pools
  - System node pools
  - User node pools
  - Support for multiple node pools with different VM sizes

### Networking Options
AKS supports several networking models:
- Kubenet (basic)
- Azure CNI (advanced)
  - Standard
  - Overlay networking
  - Bring your own CNI
- Network policies using Calico or Azure Network Policy

## Built-in Tooling

### Identity and Access Management
- Azure Active Directory integration
- Managed Identities
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Azure Key Vault integration
- Pod Identity

### Monitoring and Diagnostics
- Container Insights
- Azure Monitor integration
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Log Analytics workspace integration
- Live container logs
- Node problem detector

### Security Features
- Microsoft Defender for Containers
- Network policies
- Pod Security Policies
- Azure Policy integration
- Private clusters
- Encryption at rest

### Development Tools
- Azure CLI with AKS extensions
- Azure DevOps integration
- Azure Container Registry integration
- Draft for app development
- Bridge to Kubernetes for local development
- Visual Studio Code integration

## Deployment Patterns

### Infrastructure Deployment
Common approaches for AKS infrastructure deployment:
- ARM templates
- Terraform
- Azure CLI
- Azure Portal
- Bicep

### Application Deployment
Standard patterns for deploying applications:
- GitOps with Flux
- Azure DevOps pipelines
- GitHub Actions
- Helm charts
- Kustomize

### Scaling Patterns
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- Cluster Autoscaling
- Node Pool Autoscaling

## Concepts

### Cluster Management
- Node pools
- Availability zones
- Cluster autoscaler
- Node image upgrades
- Maintenance windows
- Backup and restore

### Application Management
- Pod disruption budgets
- Pod security contexts
- Resource quotas
- Limit ranges
- Network policies
- Storage classes

### Integration Points
- Azure Load Balancer
- Application Gateway Ingress Controller
- Azure Files
- Azure Disks
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Monitor
- Azure Policy

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use Azure AD integration
- Implement network policies
- Enable pod security policies
- Regular cluster upgrades
- Private API server endpoint
- Just-in-time access

### Networking
- Plan IP addressing carefully
- Use Azure CNI for advanced scenarios
- Implement network policies
- Configure proper DNS settings
- Use internal load balancers where appropriate

### Operations
- Use multiple node pools
- Implement proper monitoring
- Set up proper logging
- Configure backup and disaster recovery
- Use pod disruption budgets
- Implement proper resource limits
