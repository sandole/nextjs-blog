Today I would like to talk about one of my favourite games these days: Clash Royale. Clash Royale is a real-time strategy game based on optimal elixir usage and playing mind games against other players.
Made by Supercell, Clash Royale is one of many famous serious games with a huge fan base. There are some simple reasons why it is one of my favourite games.

- Short playing time: for normal adults with things to do, games should not take long. With average playing time of 3-5 minutes per game, Clash Royale is great for those without a ton of free time to play games.
- Multi-player feature: my favourite part about this game is its ability to allow players to match with another player for a 2 vs 2. I often play this mode with my girlfriend; we would argue about whose fault the loss was but that is also a part of this game that I like.
- Continuous development: I find that games of this kind often run into very similar issue: very unfriendly to beginners and meta sets (decks for this game) ruining the variety in the game. This game ensures that beginners do not have to suffer through a massive curve by throwing a ton of rewarding events. The meta decks are constatly changing thanks to the developers of the game nerfing the cards with highest win rates and buffing cards with lowest win rates.

As an adult with 9-to-5 job with things to do, this game may be a great choice. For those interested in either joining our clan or playing with us, reach me at King in game!
