summary: Age of Empires is a real-time strategy game 
---

Age of Empires is a real-time strategy game made by Relic Entertainment continuing its legacy series: Age of Empires. Released very recently aroound end of October, this upgraded game now boasts spectacular graphics with intense game mechanics. Those that are familiar with other real-time strategy games like Starcraft should realize what a huge achievement this is.
Moreover, Age of Empires 4 is closer to 2 than 3 due to Age of Empires 3's failure to impress the fanbase. I have personally played 2,3,4 and enjoyed them all. I do totally understand why many people would be disappointed with 3.
Another interesting fact about this is that Age of Empires 3 was released in October 2005 which means that it has been 16 years since the release of the last series. This makes me wonder what is happening with the company's intent and the future of this game series. 
Regardless, there is a huge fanbase building up for Age of Empires 4 and I am excited to spectate some of the competitive game scenes. I find that it is not until these games go through competitions that the game really balances itself out. By balancing, I mean balance patches for each units and nations to weaken the overpowered and buff the never-played's, sometimes maps have problems and sometimes even certain game mechanisms can be abused to gain a competitive advantage.
  
Some interesting things about this game was that it was produced using Essence Engine. This engine is definitely not mainstream among the ones that other popular game companies use. This game also features very retro-like touch to all the elements in the game. This makes me think that the fourth series was really only produced to meet the expectations of the fanbase.
