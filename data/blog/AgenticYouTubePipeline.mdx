summary: How I built an AI agent that autonomously extracts, captions, and uploads YouTube Shorts — with me as the quality gate, not the operator

## The Agentic AI Paradigm Shift

Traditional automation is brittle: write scripts, handle edge cases, pray nothing breaks. **Agentic AI** flips this model. Instead of programming every decision tree, you give an AI agent:

1. **Goals** — "Create engaging YouTube Shorts from this content"
2. **Tools** — FFmpeg, WhisperX, YouTube API, file system access
3. **Autonomy** — The agent decides *how* to achieve the goal
4. **Guardrails** — Human review for quality-critical decisions

The agent isn't following a script. It's *reasoning* about what to do next, *using tools* to accomplish subtasks, and *adapting* when things go wrong.

## My Setup: Jarvis, the Content Agent

I run [Clawdbot](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot), an agentic AI framework that gives Claude persistent memory, tool access, and the ability to operate autonomously. My instance — Jarvis — handles everything from code reviews to calendar management.

For this project, Jarvis became my **content creation agent**:

                    │   Review    │
                    └─────────────┘
```

The key difference from traditional automation: **the agent plans its own execution path**.

## Agentic Capabilities in Action

### 1. Autonomous Planning

When I say "process this movie into Shorts," Jarvis doesn't execute a fixed script. It *reasons*:

```
User: Process tears_of_steel.mp4 into YouTube Shorts

Jarvis (thinking):
- First, I need to analyze the video for high-engagement moments
- The video is 12 minutes, so I'll look for 30-60 second segments
- I should check if WhisperX transcription exists... it doesn't
- I'll transcribe first, then use the transcript to find interesting dialogue
- After extraction, each clip needs vertical conversion and captions
- Finally, I'll queue them for human review before upload
```

This planning happens in natural language, visible in the agent's reasoning traces. If something fails (quota exceeded, file missing), it re-plans.

### 2. Tool Use & Composition

The agent has access to shell commands, file operations, and APIs. It *composes* these tools dynamically:

```javascript
// Agent's tool calls (simplified)
exec("whisperx tears_of_steel.mp4 --output_format json")
read("tears_of_steel.json")  // Parse transcript
// Agent reasons: "Timestamp 3:42 has high-energy dialogue"
exec("ffmpeg -ss 222 -t 45 -i tears_of_steel.mp4 clip_001.mp4")
exec("node add-captions-ass.js clip_001.mp4")
// Agent decides: "Clip looks good, sending for review"
message({ action: "send", buttons: [["✅ Approve", "❌ Reject"]] })
```

The agent doesn't need a pre-built pipeline script. It understands the *goal* and selects appropriate tools.

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop as a Design Pattern

Full autonomy is dangerous for public-facing content. Bad titles, copyrighted clips, or low-quality extracts could hurt the channel. The solution: **human-in-the-loop (HITL)**.

The agent operates autonomously *until* a quality-critical decision point:

```
AUTONOMOUS                    HUMAN REVIEW                AUTONOMOUS
     │                              │                          │
     ▼                              ▼                          ▼
┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐    ┌─────────┐
│ Analyze │───▶│ Extract │───▶│ Caption │───▶│ Review  │───▶│ Upload  │
│         │    │         │    │         │    │ (Human) │    │         │
└─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
```

I receive clips via Telegram with inline buttons:

```
🎬 Review: Tears of Steel Clip #3

Title: "The Robot's Memory Hack" 🤖

[✅ Approve] [❌ Reject] [✏️ Edit]
```

One tap. The agent handles everything else.

This pattern — **automate the tedious, gate the critical** — is central to production agentic systems. The agent does 95% of the work; I provide the 5% that requires judgment.

### 4. Memory & State Management

Agents need memory to operate over time. Jarvis maintains:

- **Session memory** — Current task context, what's been tried
- **Persistent memory** — `MEMORY.md` file with long-term learnings
- **State files** — `upload-queue.json`, `pipeline-status.json`

When I return hours later, Jarvis knows:
- Which clips are pending review
- What's been uploaded
- Rate limit status (6 uploads/hour)
- Any errors that need attention

```markdown
# From Jarvis's MEMORY.md

## YouTube Pipeline Learnings
- Clips under 30s perform better
- Avoid extracting segments with music (copyright risk)
- Upload queue rate: 6/hour to avoid shadowbans
- Telegram review flow working well — 10-15 clips reviewed in ~3 min
```

### 5. Error Handling & Recovery

Traditional scripts crash on unexpected errors. Agentic systems *reason* about failures:

```
Error: YouTube API quota exceeded

Jarvis (reasoning):
- Upload failed due to quota
- I should mark this clip as "pending_retry"
- Check when quota resets... midnight UTC
- Update the queue status
- Notify John that uploads are paused
- Set a reminder to retry tomorrow
```

The agent doesn't just log an error — it *adapts* its plan.

## Why This Matters

### The Agent Advantage

| Traditional Automation | Agentic AI |
|------------------------|------------|
| Fixed scripts | Dynamic planning |
| Fails on edge cases | Adapts to failures |
| Manual error handling | Self-correcting |
| One-shot execution | Persistent operation |
| Requires developer intervention | Human-in-the-loop for quality |

### Production Readiness

This isn't a demo. The pipeline has processed **100+ clips** across multiple source videos with:
- Zero manual script intervention
- ~5 min total review time per batch
- Automatic retry on failures
- Rate limiting preventing platform issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Agents need clear tool boundaries.** Don't give an agent raw `exec` without sandboxing. Scope tools to specific capabilities.

2. **Human-in-the-loop isn't a crutch — it's a feature.** For content creation, human judgment at key points prevents costly mistakes.

3. **Memory is essential.** Without persistent state, agents lose context and repeat work. File-based memory works surprisingly well.

4. **Natural language planning > rigid workflows.** The agent's ability to reason in English about what to do next makes debugging trivial.

5. **Start autonomous, add gates.** Build the fully automated version first, then identify where human review adds value.

## What's Next

- **Feedback loops**: Use YouTube analytics to teach the agent what clips perform well
- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Separate agents for analysis, editing, and distribution
- **A/B testing**: Agent generates title variants, learns from click-through rates
