summary: Engineers often undermine the power of dependencies

When maintaining a website deployment for a long duration, something that engineers often undermine is the power of dependencies. Today, I fell into that trap.
The deployment of this blog has stopped for a long time due to mdx-bundler and esbuild having circular dependency issues. Here is what that looked like:
```
npm ERR! code ERESOLVE
npm ERR! ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm ERR! 
npm ERR! While resolving: mdx-bundler@9.0.1
npm ERR! Found: esbuild@0.15.10

npm ERR! node_modules/mdx-bundler
npm ERR!   mdx-bundler@"^9.0.1" from the root project
```
I came to resolve this issue by using yarn which acted as a wrapper to npm. First start by deleting package-lock.json and node_modules directory. Then install yarn using npm and install all node modules using yarn. 
Yarn as a package manager automatically fixes all dependencies as you run build commands.  

Another issue I came across was a module named globby with no longer support for require in Javascript. For this issue, I just had to downgrade the version of globby to 11.0.4 from 12.0.2. 
A recommendation for preventing issues like this is keeping a .nvm folder to maintain fixed versions of packages and dependencies.

P.S. reminder to disable any linting rules in .eslintrc.js and test the build locally for faster deployments!
