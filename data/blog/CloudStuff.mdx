I have been searching online for cloud projects I can do (for filling in my resume? for demonstrating that I can create and develop on Azure?) and I came across some resources. I specifically looked for Azure things because of my preference for Microsoft products but also all of their learning and examination is provided for free to me:  

Here are some examples of these resources:  

- Building a resume API with Javascript and Azure Functions. This one is interesting because the blogger thought of creating his resume using Azure Functions. Developers use this tool for API but who knew it could be used for resume API? Link is down below:

- The Cloud Resume Challenge. This one is famous because it has been around for a while (2 years as of this blog) and it talks primarily about AWS and related services. I probably will not do most of the things the blogger suggest but I could probably give it a spin and implement something similar on Azure. Link:

- 100 Days of Cloud: This is an open source collaborative projects where people come to share ideas about cloud projects. I guess I was not the only one who struggled to come up with a creative cloud project and someone took the initiative to do this. I am planning on trying out some of the level 200 (Intermediate) projects for Azure. Can't hurt to show that I can do more things on Azure, right?

I am also coming across a bunch of forums online where Amazon is hiring aggresively and therefore it is more likely for software engineer candidates to get a job with them. Hearing this, I am enticed to orient my studies towards AWS. This aggression is also seen via the amount of sponsored contests on Leetcode: Amazon Pay, AWS, Amazon this, Amazon that...

For now, I guess I will continue to study more Leetcode and establish more creative projects while putting up with a full time job...
