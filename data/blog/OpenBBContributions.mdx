summary: Contributing to OpenBB Platform with ISO 3166 Country standardization and migrating from deprecated pydocstyle to Ruff
---

I recently merged my first couple of pull requests into [OpenBB](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB), the open-source investment research platform. Here's what I contributed and why it matters.

## PR #7333: Standardizing Country Inputs with ISO 3166

**[feat(platform): standardize country inputs with ISO 3166 Country type](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/pull/7333)**

OpenBB has dozens of data providers, each with their own way of handling country inputs. Some expect `US`, others `USA`, some want `United States`. This inconsistency creates friction for users and extra work for provider developers.

### The Solution

I added a custom `Country` type backed by a static ISO 3166 JSON dataset. It accepts:

- **Alpha-2 codes**: `US`, `CA`, `GB`
- **Alpha-3 codes**: `USA`, `CAN`, `GBR`
- **Full names**: `United States`, `Canada`, `United Kingdom`
- **Snake case**: `united_states`, `united_kingdom`

All inputs normalize to alpha-2 codes internally, with access to full country metadata via properties.

```python
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.data import Country

# All of these work:
country = Country("US")
country = Country("USA")
country = Country("United States")
country = Country("united_states")

# Access metadata
country.alpha_2    # "US"
country.alpha_3    # "USA"
country.name       # "United States"
country.numeric    # "840"
```

### Why It Matters

This partially addresses [issue #6969](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/issues/6969) and gives provider developers a reusable type for consistent country handling. No more hardcoded mapping dictionaries scattered across the codebase.

## PR #7346: Migrating from pydocstyle to Ruff

**[chore(lint): migrate from pydocstyle to ruff](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/pull/7346)**

This one's a cleanup contribution. [pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle) was deprecated and archived in November 2023, but OpenBB was still running it in CI alongside Ruff.

### The Problem

- pydocstyle has known bugs that will never be fixed (like D402 false positives)
- Ruff already has full parity with pydocstyle's rules
- Running both tools was redundant

### The Fix

```toml
# ruff.toml - Added "D" rules (pydocstyle equivalent)
select = [
    "D",  # pydocstyle
    # ... other rules
]
```

Changes:
1. Added `"D"` (pydocstyle) rules to `ruff.toml`
2. Migrated ignore rules from `.pydocstyle.ini` to `ruff.toml`
3. Removed pydocstyle from CI workflow
4. Deleted `.pydocstyle.ini`

One less deprecated tool in the chain, same linting coverage.

## Why OpenBB?

OpenBB is building what Bloomberg Terminal could have been if it started today — open-source, extensible, and community-driven. Their platform aggregates data from dozens of financial data providers into a unified API.

As someone working on investment tooling at BCI, contributing upstream to OpenBB felt like a natural fit. The codebase is well-organized, the maintainers are responsive, and there's plenty of room for meaningful contributions.

If you're interested in fintech or quantitative finance, I'd recommend checking out their [good first issues](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/labels/good%20first%20issue).
