It has been a long and arduous journey to obtain as many Microsoft Azure certifications as possible. So far, I have obtained AZ-900, AZ-104, AZ-204, AZ-305, AZ-500, AZ-400 within a span of just half a year. It is a little sad that a lot of these certifications expire in a year and will therefore require constant retesting to remain certified.  

For the time being, I will take a break on obtaining any more Azure certifications and move onto either other certifications or more towards application work experience.
