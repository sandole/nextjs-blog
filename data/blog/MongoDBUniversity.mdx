MongoDB is a well-known company that supplies all scales of database from small developers to large companies. More specifically, they are a document-oriented NoSQL database program.

They are a crucial part of the modern MERN stack which happens to be one of the most popular web app tech stacks of 2021. I came across their website while trying to build some web apps of my own. Then, I realized they have a LMS just like any other large companies that offer free courses. I guess they are a public company with lots of cashflow...

Regardless, I have been hacking away at some of their courses: M001 and M220JS. I have finished both and each take quite a bit of time as the learners must take some time of their own to fully grasp the teaching points.

I passed the final exam for both with ease (100% and 93% respectively) - which is to say that maybe these exams were designed NOT for failure. I also noticed they offer certification of their own with 60 multiple questions and USD \$150 exam cost. Unfortunately, I don't happen to have a spare USD \$150 (approx. CAD $200) that I can throw at this exam without a guarentee of decent employment.

So maybe in the future, I will actively seek out opportunities for people to sponsor me (military scholarship maybe?) to take exams like this so I can become a better certified software developer.
