The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources.

I am finally done with The Odin Project. I haven't quite finished all the projects in the curriculum but I feel good about the things I learned and able to put on my portfolio as a result. I will have these said projects stored in my repos for those who are interested. 

The Odin Project was interesting for other reasons as well. It has a community of its own (check out its discord channel; vibrant and resourceful), students come from all kinds of countries and backgrounds and it is a continuously evolving project. I noticed certain parts lack materials and guidance: an example is how the HTML and CSS portion of the full stack course has weak materials mostly composed of external links and brief explanations. Regardless, it is undeniable that certain materials are very thorough and helpful for junior web developers. I do wonder how the course will change as newer languages and stacks come out to replace the old ones.
