I have received my certification for Azure fundamentals! Although this course is not a prerequisite to any other further in-depth courses, I thought it would be a good idea to start with this course if I wanted a gradual and thorough understanding of Azure and its functions.  

The Voucher for the exam that got me this certification was granted by Microsoft themselves. They occasionally have what they call "cloud challenges" which allow users to take the online learn curriculum and upon completion will grant a one-time voucher code. This code can be used only once (no retake) on Microsoft.  

I took the exam through a proctored version where PearsonVue requires the exam takers to take meticulous actions to prevent any cheating or non-standard way to achieving a passing score. We even have to sign an NDA.

For those that are interested in either the cloud challenge or starting your Azure career by taking some of the certifications, check out Microsoft Learn. Everything can be free!
