I now received my certificate for AZ-104 Certificate for Azure Administrator Associate. I was able to pass the exam within a week apart from my AZ-900 because I was prepared for it since last week too. Microsoft announced that the vouchers would be given out on Jan. 10th so I was prepared to take both exams by that date.

However, due to the popularity and logistical issues, they gave the voucher for this exam just today. I was luckily able to book an exam on the day of as well. 

This exam was definitely much harder than AZ-900. It covers more materials with more technical details. This course also acts as a prerequisite to some like Azure Solutions Architect (ASA) which is ultimately what I aim for from this series of certifications.

I have a voucher that expires in March 14 which would give me more than enough time to study for another certificate if I studied intensely. Unfortunately, this voucher is only valid for AZ-204 Azure Developer Associate. So my goal would be to grab that first then finally obtain ASA once another event with a free voucher comes out or I may end up paying at that point. We shall see.
