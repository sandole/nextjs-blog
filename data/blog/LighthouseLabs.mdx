The Lighthouse Labs have a challenge event for coders of all experience. They offer tech education for the newbie and the professional developer, using industry-driven part-time and full-time training programs. Find out more at https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en.

Back to the challenge: they want to encourage coders to develop a habit by doing snippet challenges that require 10-20 minutes of your time every day for 21 days straight. I personally found these challenges to be extremely easy. If ever you are stuck on it, the hints and small number of test cases should get you the pass quite easily. 

Today marks day 11 and for today's challenge was simply iterating through an array and one simple flow control statement. I should say I am a little bit disappointed with the difficulty of these challenges; earlier ones took at most 5 seconds. 

There are prize draws happening for each completed challenge and a grand prize as well. Hopefully I do end up taking *something* away from this challenge.
