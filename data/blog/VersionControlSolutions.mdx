summary: source code management is critical in engineering productivity
---

Collaboration between engineers and various stakeholders is crucial for a company to iterate through their phases in project management.
These projects ultimately build the revenue for the companies which means that selecting which collaboration tool - specifically version control - is critical in engineering productivity.
Here are some of the popular and industry leading version control system based on Git: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Azure Repos.
GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git as a version control system. It provides project management features, code review, and collaboration tools. 
GitHub is popular among developers and is often used to host open-source projects.
Due to GitHub's popularity, choosing this as your repository strategy may be good since it is widely used and well-known, so it's easy to find help and resources online.
GitHub offers enterprise pricing plans that are customized to meet the needs of individual organizations. 
The specific cost of a GitHub enterprise license will depend on the specific features and services included in the plan.
GitLab is a web-based Git repository manager that provides source code management (SCM), continuous integration, and more. 
It includes a built-in issue tracker, code review tools, and a wiki.
Developed by GitLab Inc, it garners interests from developers all around the world due to its narrow support made by a small team on a small product.
GitLab is very popular with undersized and "underdog" companies who are looking to be as agile as possible.
GitLab still packs a punch with the full suite of support for source code management as well as continuous integration and deployment.
Bitbucket is a Git and Mercurial version control system that is used for code management and collaboration. 
It offers features such as pull requests and code reviews, as well as integration with a number of other tools and services.
Since Bitbucket is developed by Atlassian, you can expect there to be a good amount of integration and enterprise support for using this with other Atlassian products like JIRA and Trello.
Azure Repos is a set of version control tools provided by Microsoft as part of the Azure DevOps suite.
It is based on Git and provides features such as pull requests, code reviews, and collaboration tools.
Its strength comes from Azure DevOps and how this set of tools can provide everything you need to be chugging along.
Personally, Azure Repos - and therefore Azure DevOps - is my favourite toolkit among these source control management softwares but Microsoft has officially stated that their favourite child moving forward will be GitHub...
All of these tools are popular choices for source control management and offer a range of features to support the development process. 
Ultimately, the choice of which tool to use may depend on the specific needs of a project and the preferences of the development team.
