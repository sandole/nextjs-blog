Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) are software development practices that involve automating the build, testing, and deployment of software. 
Together, these practices form a CI/CD pipeline, which is a series of automated processes that allow developers to rapidly and reliably deliver code changes to production.
In this blog, I want to talk briefly about some common industry CI/CD solutions and their differences. 
Namely, these are Tekton, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, CircleCI and Jenkins.
Tekton, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps are all tools that can be used to automate software development processes, such as building, testing, and deploying code.
Here is a brief overview of the main differences between these tools:

- Tekton is an open-source framework for building CI/CD pipelines that is designed to be cloud-native and vendor-agnostic. It is based on the Kubernetes container orchestration platform and provides a way to define and execute pipeline tasks using simple, declarative YAML configuration files.

- CircleCI is a cloud-based CI/CD platform that provides a variety of tools and integrations for building, testing, and deploying code. It supports a wide range of programming languages and technologies, and offers features such as parallelism and caching to speed up build and test times.

- Jenkins is an open-source CI/CD server that can be used to automate the build, test, and deployment of software. It is highly configurable and can be extended with a wide range of plugins, making it a popular choice for organizations with complex build and deployment processes.

- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that is integrated with the GitHub version control platform. It allows developers to automate their workflow by creating custom CI/CD pipelines using pre-defined actions or by writing custom actions in JavaScript.

- Azure DevOps is a cloud-based platform that provides a range of tools and services for planning, developing, delivering, and operating software. It includes features such as agile planning tools, Git version control, and CI/CD pipelines, as well as tools for testing and deployment.

In general, Tekton and Jenkins are more flexible and customizable than CircleCI and GitHub Actions, but they may require more setup and maintenance. 
Azure DevOps is a comprehensive platform that provides a range of tools and services for software development, but it may be more expensive and complex than some of the other options. 
Ultimately, the best choice for your organization will depend on your specific needs and requirements.
