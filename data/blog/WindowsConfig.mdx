summary: full VM infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible and Puppet
---

Setting up a Windows virtual machine (VM) infrastructure in the cloud is used for many purposes. 
Some use this group of Windows VM for running self hosted applications like self-hosted integration runtime or maybe the developers require the robustness of a full IaaS capabilities instead of using PaaS like Azure App Services.
This blog will demonstrate how to deploy a full Windows VM infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible and Puppet.

My approach to setting up this infrastructure begins with Terraform. 
Terraform is great for creating that base layer of infrastructure like all the networking required and resource deployment on the cloud of your choice.
For this blog, this infrastructure will be deployed on Azure.
The code below is a very simple example for deploying a 3 VM infrastructure.
You may modularize this for better DRY principles or use wrappers like Terragrunt to remove redundancy and improve scalability.

```
provider "azurerm" {
  version = "~> 2.38.0"
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resource-group"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "example-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefix       = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

resource "azurerm_windows_virtual_machine" "example" {
  count                = 3
  name                 = "example-vm-${count.index+1}"
  location             = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  network_interface_ids = [azurerm_network_interface.example[count.index].id]
  vm_size              = "Standard_D2_v2"

  storage_os_disk {
    name              = "example-os-disk-${count.index+1}"
    caching           = "ReadWrite"
    create_option     = "FromImage"
    managed_disk_type = "Standard_LRS"
  }

  storage_image_reference {
    publisher = "MicrosoftWindowsServer"
    offer     = "WindowsServer"
    sku       = "2019-Datacenter"
    version   = "latest"
  }

  os_profile {
    computer_name  = "example-vm-${count.index+1}"
    admin_username = "adminuser"
    admin_password = "P@ssw0rd!"
  }

  os_profile_windows_config {
    provision_vm_agent = true
    enable_automatic_updates = true
  }
}
```
  
The code above will deploy the base infrastructure for a 3 VM environment.
The industry best practices criticizes the use of count in Terraform in a dynamic environment.
Instead, use for_each. For more information on why: https://www.danzabinski.com/posts/tf-comparing-count-and-for_each/
  
Next, Puppet is used for the basic configuration management.
Things like software installs, changing OS-level configuration values and firewall rules can be set via Puppet.
Note that although Chocolatey is an excellent package management tool for Windows, some of the packages are outdated and should be tested and checked to see the installation was successful.

```
# Install the chocolatey package manager
package { 'chocolatey':
  ensure   => present,
  provider => 'chocolatey',
}

# Install 7zip and Notepad++ using chocolatey
package { ['7zip', 'notepadplusplus']:
  ensure   => present,
  provider => 'chocolatey',
}

# Set the hostname to "windows-vm"
host { 'windows-vm':
  ensure => present,
}

# Enable Remote Desktop
registry_key { 'HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server':
  ensure  => present,
  values  => { 'fDenyTSConnections' => {
                'type'  => 'dword',
                'data'  => 0,
              }
            },
  require => Package['chocolatey'],
}

# Configure the firewall to allow incoming RDP connections
firewall { 'allow RDP':
  dport   => 3389,
  proto   => tcp,
  action  => accept,
  require => Package['chocolatey'],
}

```
  
Finally, we use Ansible to continue our day two management of this infrastructure.
Ansible requires Python to be installed on managed hosts.
SSH connection from the Ansible server also needs to be allowed.
As an example of continuous configuration management, I added more softwares to install and IP allocation within the private subnet.

```

    ip_address: 192.168.1.100
