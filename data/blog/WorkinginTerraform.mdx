summary: I have had a good experience developing in Terraform
---

As a cloud engineer, I have had a good experience developing in Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.
When we help our clients through their cloud adoption journey, both our team and our client learned a lot on the way.

Here are a set of standard practice we have established that we learned through experience:
- Creating a landing zone can be done using three official sources: internal landing zone models, Microsoft landing zone model (https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones) and HashiCorp landing zone registry (https://registry.terraform.io/).
- Pipelining CI/CD in Terraform should at the minimum consist of tflint, tfsec, OPA (unit testing in Terraform), steampipe (framework compliance like CIS), checkov (Policy-as-code similar to TFE Sentinel), and Terratest for any other testing requirements.
- Follow good engineering principles like SOLID or DRY. Other software engineering principles shall be respected even when developing in a declarative language like Terraform or HCL. 

I have also strived towards gaining a couple of certifications in Terraform. The two that I have achieved and are considered the de facto standard in this industry are: HashiCorp Infrastructure Automation Certification and CHIP.
Doing the labs on the HashiCorp partner portal for a Terraform Enterprise Implementation Foundation certificate, 
obtaining HashiCorp Infrastructure Automation Certification and attending a 1-day workshop with HashiCorp Solutions Engineer will grant a Certified HashiCorp Implementation Partner certification - a.k.a CHIP.
