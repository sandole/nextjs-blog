# Hi, welcome to my blog!

## Who Am I?

I'm John Seong, a Senior Software Developer at WestJet where I lead the Integration and API Management team. With a background spanning cloud engineering, DevOps, and backend development, I've dedicated my career to building robust, scalable systems that make a difference.

My journey began in 2015 at the Royal Military College of Canada, where I pursued computer engineering through a unique military-subsidized program. This opportunity allowed me to combine academic studies with hands-on IT support for military operations, laying a strong foundation for my technical career.

What sets my path apart is my commitment to service. I spent seven enriching years as a military officer in the Canadian Armed Forces, supporting critical IT infrastructure and operations. This experience taught me invaluable lessons about soft skills like leadership, resilience, and the importance of being a reliable team. Thanks to Avanade, I successfully transitioned to the private sector, where I've continued to grow and innovate in cloud technology.

As a Senior Software Developer at WestJet, I lead the Integration and API Management team, where I focus on optimizing our cloud infrastructure and API ecosystem. One of my key achievements has been implementing an API management layer that fronts our internal APIs hosted on Kubernetes. As the technical SME, I help drive architectural decisions that shape WestJet's digital transformation journey, focusing on scalable and efficient solutions that enhance our airline's operational capabilities.

Beyond my professional work, I'm passionate about continuous learning and community involvement. I actively contribute to the Green Software Foundation, focusing on optimized infrastructure provisioning. I maintain an active lifestyle through competitive basketball and ground myself through participation in local Christian services.

## My Story

My fascination with technology began in 2003 when my elementary school launched its first website. I was captivated by the ability to share content and connect with others through this new medium. That early experience sparked a belief that technology's greatest power lies in its ability to bring people together â€“ a principle that still guides my work today.

Choosing to attend the Royal Military College of Canada was a pivotal decision shaped by both practical considerations and a desire to serve. Coming from an immigrant family, the fully subsidized education offered a path to pursue my dreams without the burden of student debt. The unique combination of military service and technical education has proven invaluable, equipping me with both technical expertise and leadership skills that inform my approach to software engineering.
