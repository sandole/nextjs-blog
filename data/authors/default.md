Hi, welcome to my blog!

**Who Am I?**  
  
My name is Minjun (John) Seong and I am currently residing in Edmonton, Alberta. Due to the nature of my current job, where I am living in or what I do can change quite frequently. I am currently a full-time Communications and Electronics Engineering (CELE) Officer in the Canadian Armed Forces serving with 3 CDSB Signals Squadron. Think of it like an information technology (IT) support for the military - serving over 10,000 personnel - and across multiple elements like Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Army.

Despite my experience in aviation, I have realized that IT is truly where my passion is at. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Royal Military College and I spend a lot of my free time exploring the web and learning a ton. I am looking to learn about a lot of new technologies and interesting things I can do online. I am also a person who likes to give myself constant challenges, stay competitive and learn new things on a regular basis. I am currently focusing on DevSecOps, cloud computing technologies and web development.  
  
I care about contributing to my community. That is why I decided to start my career off by repaying my debts to this country. I did this by becoming a military officer and supporting many military operations and exercises. After 7 years of serving in the Canadian military, I am looking forward to starting a career in the software engineering industry. Thanks to Avanade, I was able to successfully transition into a cloud engineer role for cool (and paid) experiences. I am really excited about this career that I feel is better suited and compensated for me. On top of that, I feel that software engineering jobs will allow me to contribute to the world more positively and effectively.  

**My Story**  
  
My first encounter with the web began when I was in elementary school. It was around year 2003 and my school had just introduced its website. In this website, students of each class were able to post contents in their own classroom splash pages. I remember when I discovered how to do this, I proceeded to surf the web for the next 5 hours scavenging funny photos and stories just to repost them for other people's entertainments. I believe the internet connects people. 
I went to a fully subsidized college called Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario (Canada) mostly because I was too afraid to take on financial debt. I came from an immigrant family so the idea of student debt or huge university loans did not seem like something I could handle. I have served many years for this country for many years now (almost 7!) and I am looking to switch my career onto a path that I feel more passionate about. I believe my background in aviation, technology and leadership will help me become an excellent software engineer!

**What is here?**    

This blog demonstrates many employable skills that I have:

1. Technical writing: technical writing has to do with documenting technical communication used in technical fields - specifically, software/computer engineering. This blog displays a good example of my documentation skills by talking about my life journey. Some of it have to do with my personal life with contents regarding gaming and others have to do with building towards a professional career. Technical writing is an important skill because it is a written form of technical communication with others. Sometimes, it has to do with leaving records for promulgation so others can obtain information without the need for the writer to individually disperse to interested parties. Also, it can be for presenting discussion topics and our technical opinion on certain subjects. This blog is a great way for readers - and potential recruiters - to observe my style for writing technical documents and not documents with amalgamated buzzwords used across the industry. The contents of this blog are also written entirely in Markdown files which are the defacto standard for how project and software documentation should be written.

2. Web Development: As the title suggests, I have implemented a personal blog using NextJS, React and TailwindCSS. I chose NextJS for the fastest server side rendering and easy template accesses and TailwindCSS for beautiful pre-made components that I felt was easy to imbed into this blog. The source code for this blog is available in my github where interested people can visit and view my coding writing practices.  
  
3. Other contents: The contents of this blog contains information about how I develop myself throughout my career. I have documented information about full-stack web development, implementing cloud solutions and DevSecOps topics. Continue reading this blog to hopefully some useful information for yourself!
