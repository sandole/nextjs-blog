Hi, welcome to my blog!

**Who Am I?**  
  
My name is Minjun Seong (or John) and I am currently residing in Edmonton, Alberta. Due to the nature of my current job, where I am living in or what I do can change quite frequently. I am currently a full-time Communications and Electronics Engineering Officer in the Canadian Armed Forces serving with 3 CDSB Signals Squadron. Despite my experience in aviation, I realized that software development is truly where my passion is at. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Royal Military College which helped me realize this. I am looking to learn about a lot of new technologies and interesting things I can do online! I like giving myself constant challenges and new things to learn on a regular basis. I am currently focusing on cloud computing technologies and web development.  
  
I care about contributions to my society and my community. That is why I decided to start my career by repaying my debts to this country for providing me with ample opportunities. I did this by becoming a military officer. After 9 years of serving in the Canadian military, I plan on releasing for a career that I feel is better suited for me. On top of that, I feel that software engineering jobs will allow me to contribute to the world more positively and effectively.  

**My Story**  
  
My first encounter with the web began when I was in elementary school. It was around year 2003 and my school had just introduced its website. In this website, students of each class were able to post contents in their own classroom directory. I remember when I discovered how to do this, I proceed to surf the web for the next 5 hours scavenging funny photos and stories just to repost them for other people's entertainments. I believe the internet connects people. 
I went to a fully subsidized college called Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario (Canada) mostly because I was too afraid to take on financial debt. I came from an immigrant family so the idea of student debt or huge university loans did not seem like something I could handle. I have served many years for this country for many years now (almost 7!) and I am looking to switch my career onto the path that I feel more passionate about. I believe my background in aviation, technology and leadership will help me become an excellent software engineer!

**What is here?**    
  
As the title suggests, I have implemented a personal blog using NextJS, React and TailwindCSS. I chose NextJS for the fastest server side rendering and easy template accesses and TailwindCSS for beautiful pre-made components that I felt was easy to imbed into this blog. In this blog, I will write about my journey as a software engineer both professionally and personally. Feel free to reach out to me!
