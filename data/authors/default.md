Hi, welcome to my blog!

*Who Am I?*
My name is Minjun Seong (or John) and I am currently residing in Edmonton, Alberta. Due to the nature of my current job, where I am living in or what I do can change quite drastically.I am currently a full-time pilot in the Canadian Armed Forces serving with 3 CDSB Signals Squadron. Despite my passion in aviations, certain circumstances helped me see that software development is truly where my passion is at. I have a bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Royal Military College which helped me get a head start. I am looking to learn about a lot of new technologies and interesting things I can do online!

*My Story*
My first encounter with the web began when I was in elementary school. It was around year 2003 and my school had just introduced its website. In this website, students of each class were able to post contents in their own classroom directory. I remember when I discovered how to do this, I proceed to surf the web for the next 5 hours scavenging funny photos and stories just to repost them for other people's entertainments. I believe the internet connects people. 
I went to a fully subsidized college in Kingston, Ontario (Canada) mostly because I was too afraid to take on financial debt. I came from an immigrant family so the idea of student debt or huge university loans did not seem like something I could handle. I have served many years for this country for many years now (almost 7!) and I am looking to go down the path where I feel more passionate about. I believe my background in aviation, technology and leadership will help me become an excellent software developer!

*What is here?*
As the title suggests, this blog is my first attempt at a full stack project. In this blog, I will feature many professional and personal sides of me. I have included some personal things like my hobby and what I spend my free time on and some professional things like my military Member's Personnel Record Resume (MPRR) and all the things that I have done that helped me become a better software engineer.
